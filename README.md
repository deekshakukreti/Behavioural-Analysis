Classification of information is known as taxanomies. Taxonomies in unstructured information serve much the same purpose as data model in structured information. Taxonomy is list of words that provides classification of some large topics. They are applied to nonrepetitive unstructured data only. Also, they require periodic update as language changes over the time.

Ontology is a taxonomy where there is inter-relationships of the element within the taxonomy.

Emails are non-repetitive unstructured data. It is simple to send emails for textual disambiguation process unless the spams and blather needs to be filtered, as they will create meaningless information to the corporation. For example, blather contains jokes that are sent throughout the organisation.
